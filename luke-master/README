luke
====

fork of http://luke.googlecode.com/svn/ to support 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.X ...
(and maybe all newer)
fixes are usually quick and dirty, so need review
I just fix what I use (e.g. no hadoop updates, ... )

I am using Netbeans (latest) + latest JDK7/8 (Suns/Oracles)
from nb I can run compile & then I run target "dist" on top of build.xml 
to get the binaries built
